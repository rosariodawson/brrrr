A 15-year-old boy comes to the ofﬁce for a screening evaluation after his father died a few months ago from a myocardial infarction at age 40. The patient is otherwise healthy and has had no chest pain or shortness of breath. He eats a balanced diet and is an athlete, playing on the high school basketball team. An evaluation reveals an anomalous aortic origin of his right coronary artery with no evidence of ischemia on stress testing. The physician explains that although patients with this condition are generally allowed to participate in sports, there is a small increased risk of sudden death and that an automated external deﬁbrillator (AED) should always be readily available. His mother says, "Basketball is his life and has been a great source of comfort to him after his father's death. I don't think you should tell my son about his diagnosis; it would only cause him to worry. I'll make sure there is always an AED available at his games." Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the

physician?

• A. "Although you're trying to protect your son from hearing about this diagnosis, I'm concerned you would be doing more harm than good by keeping it from him."

• B. "Given his age and ability to understand the diagnosis, it's inappropriate for me to keep this from him, especially since he will still be playing basketball."

O c. "it's difﬁcult to share upsetting news, but your son needs to know what he is at risk for and learn to recognize potentially deadly symptoms."

• D. "Knowing his diagnosis could help him be aware of potential symptoms; let's ﬁrst talk about what information he would be told and how it would be shared."

• E. "You and your family have been through a lot recently; I understand if you would like to share this diagnosis with him at a later

time."

A 65-year-old man with a history of obesity, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease is undergoing combined valve repair and coronary artery bypass grafting. Multiple complications prolong the case by several hours.

Administrators at a busy multicenter hospital are concerned about a higher-than-average incidence of retained surgical objects (RSO) following complex abdominal surgery. Current hospital procedures require the circulating nurse and a scrub nurse to conduct an initial count of surgical sponges and instruments before surgery begins; this number must then be reconciled during a ﬁnal count prior to ﬁnishing the procedure. However, the administrators ﬁnd that most instances of RSO occurred even when nurses had followed hospital counting procedures and reconciled the ﬁnal count. Upon reviewing video recordings of the teams working in the operative setting, the administrators note that counts are time-intensive, constituting 15% of total operation time. In addition, during the ﬁnal count, nurses experience distractions, such as alarms and background music, and frequent interruptions from surgeons asking the nurses for items necessary to close the incision. Which of the following interventions is recommended to improve quality of the counting procedure in this setting?

• A. Addressing levels of authority and intimidation within teams

• B. Engaging teams in simulation-based exercises focusing on closed-loop communication

• C. Having another team member independently repeat the count after the ﬁnal count is completed

• D. Having nurses call a brief time-out prior to starting the ﬁnal counting process

• B. Involve the patient's mother and explain the need for surgery to the patient in simple language
